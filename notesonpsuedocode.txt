Example problem:
Convert a full name to a first and last name.

Full names:
Frances Little
Emma Alexandra
Avery Ruel

What data is in this problem?
A full name.

What data structures do I need to model that data?
A string.

How do you process this data to get it into the form I need?
I need a first name and last name, so I need two STRINGS. The first and last names are split up by a space. So I need to find the space in the full name and split the full name string at the space.

What control flow do I need to process that data?
I need to loop over the full name string character by characteruntil I find the space and then split the string at the index of that space.

What data do I need to output?
Two strings.

What functions, methods, or APIs are available to let me perform this processing?
Strings have a split method.
