//CONTROL FLOW

//Loop - a type of control flowing javascript, repeat a section of code.
//Conditional statements - when we want to check if a condition is true and only run code if that condition is met.
//Use conditional statements for checking conditions. run a section of code based on some contion.

/*
if (some condition is true) {
    do something...
}
*/

// For Loops

for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    //inside the curly braces is known 
    //as a code block
}
/*
// let i = 0 is the initialization variable.
// this keeps track of how many times we cycle through the loop and how many times we run the code inside the loop
// i < 5 is the condition. Evaluates whether true or false. If true, will execute the code inside the code block.
// i++ is going to execute every time at the end of the code block, add one to i

for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    console.log('in loop:', i);
